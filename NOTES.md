## Connecting to the badge

    * look for a `/dev/tty*` file that looks fishy (ex: `/dev/tty.usbmodemFD121`)
* screen into it (ex `screen /dev/tty.usbmodemFD121`)
    * when you do this you'll see a maze that you can control with the defcon logo in the bottom right (it's a `d-pad` 😺)
* to disconnect run  (`ctrl + a`) then release and hit `d`
    * NOTE: when you do this, if you run `screen /dev/tty.usbmodemFD121` you'll get the following error `Sorry, could not find a PTY.`
        * to fix just unplug your badge and plug it a back in then run `screen /dev/tty.usbmodemFD121` again and you should see the maze \o/
